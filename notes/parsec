PARSEC experiment

compress stage in dedup

1/ Measure execution time with normal compression n_t and compression stage time n_t_s
2/ Measure execution time with fast compression f_t and compression stage time f_t_s

stage speedup is tdf = n_t_s / f_t_s

3/ Measure execution time with normal compression sped up by tdf.
